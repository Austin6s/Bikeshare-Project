# Bikeshare Project

The purpose of this project is to use pandas to read a .csv file from three different data sets and calculate interesting statistics dependent on filters designated by the user. The data sets all contain information about the bikeshare system in three major cities: Chicago, New York, and Washington.

## Package Requirements

I used the latest versions of all of these packages:

time; sys; pandas: version=1.3.2

## Installation

For this project I used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to install the necessary packages needed to complete this project.

```bash
conda install pandas
```
